  Financials have sprinted higher since late last year when the first vaccine
  was approved in the U.S., which prompted optimism about the eventual economic
  recovery—one that is now unfolding.
</p>
<p>
  This equity sector has significantly outperformed the overall market, surging
  38 percent since early November 2020, double the S&amp;P 500’s gain of 19
  percent and outpacing all other sectors (excluding Energy).
</p>
<p>Is there further to go? We think so.</p>
<p>
  Certainly the recent run has been eye-popping. But some additional context is
  useful. Actually, the sector’s performance has yet to catch up to the S&amp;P
  500 going back to just before the COVID-19 earthquake hit.

      The chart shows that the Financials sector has outperformed the broader
      U.S. equity market and other key segments significantly since November 9,
      2020, when the Pfizer vaccine was approved. Financials are up 39.7% since
      then, whereas the broader "value" category is up 24%, the S&amp;P 500 is
      up 18.8%, and the "growth" category is up only 14.4% during the same
      period.

  Financials are still trailing the S&amp;P 500, with a gain of 21 percent for
  the former and 31 percent for the latter, since the beginning of 2020—a time
  frame that takes into account the severe selloff during the worst stage of the
  COVID-19 pandemic over a year ago.
</p>
<p>
  We think there is more catch-up room ahead for U.S. Financials because of
  numerous catalysts.
</p>
<h4>Maintaining the mojo</h4>
<p>
  A number of the sector’s tailwinds are related to the early stage of the
  economic recovery, while others are due to the overall sturdy nature of
  banking operations in the U.S. and some breathing room on the regulatory
  front.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold"
    >We think the following potential catalysts should push the Financials
    sector higher:</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold">Early-cycle impulses:</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Financials
  tend to outperform in the early part of the economic recovery cycle, along
  with the overall value/cyclicals category, of which the sector is a component.
  The market rally associated with this stage typically has two phases—first, a
  sprint out of the gate (which has already occurred, but could continue), and
  then a consolidation period or pullback followed by a renewed rally that
  transpires at a slower pace (the second leg of the rally). Historically, the
  Financials sector has not only outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during the sprint
  out of the gate but also outperformed during the second leg of the rally,
  according to a study by RBC Capital Markets, LLC’s Head of U.S. Equity
  Strategy Lori Calvasina.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold">A beneficiary of inflation:<span>&nbsp;</span></span
  >When the public perceives that inflation will increase, Energy, Materials,
  and Financials tend to outperform the most, according to Calvasina’s data
  going back to 2004, which is shown in a chart toward the end of this “<a
    href="/ca/en/research-insights/inflation-aftershock-the-implication-for-investors/detail/"
    >Inflation aftershock</a
  >” article. We think the buoyant May inflation data that was just released,
  with the Consumer Price Index jumping five percent from last year, is
  supportive of this catalyst.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold">The potential to hike dividends:<span>&nbsp;</span></span
  >The banking analyst at our national research correspondent anticipates
  “substantial dividend increases,” including roughly 20 percent hikes for some
  of the largest institutions, and rising dividend payout ratios over the next
  18 months. While the regulatory environment for banks is still tighter than it
  was before the global financial crisis in 2008–09—and will likely remain
  so—there has been some easing in requirements, and industry analysts
  anticipate the allowance of further dividend increases. This aforementioned
  analyst and RBC Capital Markets, LLC’s Head of U.S. Bank Equity Strategy
  Gerard Cassidy anticipate some movement on the dividend front following the
  release of the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
  (CCAR) of the banking industry, scheduled for June 24.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold">Fund flows firing:<span>&nbsp;</span></span
  >Strong inflows of cash have poured into Financials sector exchange-traded
  funds (ETFs), outpacing all other sectors in absolute dollar amounts so far
  this year, and edging out all other sectors as a proportion of assets under
  management in the past 12 months. We think the Financials sector’s recent
  outperformance will further boost inflows from a category of ETFs that has
  become popular—“momentum” funds. These securities include stocks that have
  experienced strong price gains and earnings trends, typically over the
  previous 12 months. For a long time Financials barely had been represented in
  momentum funds due to the sector’s previous underperformance; instead, these
  funds were dominated by technology-related stocks. But now we think that is
  set to change as momentum ETFs rebalance over time to include stocks that have
  performed well more recently.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold"
    >Better profitability due to yield curve dynamics:<span>&nbsp;</span></span
  >While we don’t foresee dramatic moves in Treasury yields over the near term,
  our fixed income strategists anticipate further modest steepening of the
  Treasury yield curve, as the 10-year yield drifts somewhat higher toward two
  percent by year end and short-term rates stay anchored as the Fed keeps its
  target rate near zero percent. Cassidy believes this will lead to higher net
  interest margins and net interest revenues for banks.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold">Improved loan growth and less excess liquidity:</span
  ><span>&nbsp;</span>Abundant stimulus from the Fed and Washington has held
  back banks’ profitability, but that should change. In a mid-May report Cassidy
  wrote, “Monetary and fiscal policy over the last 12+ months has led to
  double-digit deposit growth and has resulted in many banks having excess
  liquidity on their balance sheets. Loan-to-deposit ratios have plummeted, and
  bank profitability has been hurt as a result. Over the next 12–18 months, we
  expect this trend to ease-up as loan growth picks up, deficit spending falls,
  and the Federal Reserve’s Quantitative Easing (QE) program comes to an end.”
</p>
<p>
  <span class="bold">Earnings momentum and then some:<span>&nbsp;</span></span
  >Financials are expected to deliver stronger earnings growth than the S&amp;P
  500 in 2021, 45.5 percent versus 33.4 percent year over year. We believe there
  is upside to the 2021 forecast and, importantly, Cassidy anticipates that 2022
  consensus estimates for banks have room to push higher. We don’t think this is
  fully factored into current stock prices.

<h4>Not done yet</h4>
<p>
  While the U.S. Financials sector has come a long way since late last year’s
  initial vaccine approval, we think it has room to run due to a full tank of
  catalysts, which should play out over the course of the next six months and
  longer. We would stay Overweight U.S. Financials. We also continue to favor
  this sector in other markets such as Canada, the UK, and Europe as similar
  economic dynamics are at play.
