  The U.S. Federal Reserve struck a more hawkish note than markets expected at
  its June meeting, driving bond prices lower and yields higher across the
  Treasury curve. Although we share the view that the meeting is important in
  understanding future Fed policy moves, we would caution that the initial
  market reaction likely overstates the impact of the changing Fed projections
  and the language of the post-meeting statement.
</p>
<h4>Interest rates: Big headline, less substance</h4>
<p>
  In terms of policy, the central bank acted as expected, maintaining the
  current federal funds rate target range and the $120 billion monthly asset
  purchase program. At the same time, the members of the Federal Open Market
  Committee (FOMC)—the rate-setting group within the Fed—updated their
  individual economic projections for growth, inflation, and policy rates. The
  previous survey, in March, produced a median projection for rates at zero
  through the 2023 end of the forecast period; in this month’s report, however,
  the median projection includes two rate hikes in 2023, leading to a federal
  funds rate of 0.625 percent.

  We think this change in the median forecast rate should carry little weight in
  investor thinking. Member projections are snapshots in time and do not
  represent a plan for future policy, a point Fed Chair Jerome Powell made
  during his post-meeting press conference. In addition, by 2023 the composition
  of the FOMC will have changed, with the rotating voting slots shifting to more
  dovish members. Prior Fed projections have not been particularly accurate
  predictors of policy rate changes, especially when dealing with minor rate
  differences years in the future.
</p>
<h4>The taper talk has begun</h4>
<p>
  While the June meeting may not have provided a clear view of future rate
  hikes, we think the meeting did move the timeline on tapering, as the Fed
  acknowledged that discussions on reducing the pace of asset purchases will
  likely begin next month—a change from the central bank’s prior stance that it
  was too early even to talk about talking about tapering. Combined with the
  Fed’s earlier guidance that it would provide months of advance notice before
  implementation, we see tapering kicking off before year’s end, potentially in
  early fall. We continue to see tapering as a year-long process, and believe a
  potential rate hike is unlikely for at least 18 months—and probably longer.

      The line chart shows that in the past three months the Fed has accepted
      more cash into its reverse repo facility than it has put into the market

  Market conditions—as well as inflation levels—likely contributed to the Fed’s
  decision to start moving toward tapering. The absolute level of yields was
  near a multi-month low heading into the week, reducing the impact of any shift
  higher in yields on the prospects for tapering. In addition, the potential for
  unforeseen liquidity consequences from tapering is limited, as investors in
  recent months have returned more cash to the Fed than the Fed has pumped into
  the system. Since March, the Fed has purchased approximately $360 billion of
  Treasury and Agency securities, while investors deposited over $490 billion
  into the Fed’s reverse-repurchase facility. Overall, it was an opportune
  moment to launch the taper process.
</p>
<h4>Inflation is transitory, except when it’s not</h4>
<p>
  Beyond taper talk, one of the most notable shifts in Fed language concerned
  inflation. The Fed still maintains—correctly, in our view—that current
  inflation is likely to prove transitory; however, the central bank now
  acknowledges the possibility that inflation may be higher and more persistent
  than it expects. In addition to the qualitative shift, the FOMC’s median
  projection for 2021 PCE inflation jumped a full percentage point between March
  and June, rising to 3.4 percent from 2.4 percent.
</p>
<p>
  One interpretation of the Fed’s more hawkish tone, consistent with its
  comments and projections on inflation, is that the central bank now views the
  likely 2021 inflation overshoot as sufficient to meet the requirements of its
  recently adopted average inflation policy. The details of that policy have
  always been vague, and the Fed may be looking to take advantage of that
  purposeful ambiguity.
</p>
<h4>Implications for investors</h4>
<p>
  While it’s easy to get caught up in the minutiae of Fed policy thinking, in
  practical terms not much has changed: the economy is still millions of jobs
  short of pre-pandemic employment levels; the ability of the Fed to sustainably
  generate sufficient inflation to overcome structural disinflation is
  questionable; and, even under optimistic assumptions, it will likely be years
  before policy rates move higher.
</p>
<p>
  But we do see two key themes emerging from this month’s meeting. First, stay
  invested. Not even the Fed can time the market; between March and June, its
  view of future rates shifted 60 basis points (bps) higher while the yield on
  the 10-year Treasury dropped 15 bps. We see little reason to think investors
  are likely to do better, and sitting on cash earning zero percent while
  waiting for the perfect bond entry point is unlikely to be a profitable
  strategy.
</p>
<p>
  Second, long-term investors should trust in diversification and asset
  allocation. Whether inflation is transitory, and how the Fed will respond if
  it is not, are important questions, but the range of possible outcomes is
  wide. We believe investors should seek an investment strategy adaptable to a
  broad range of scenarios; a diversified portfolio, rebalanced appropriately,
  is among the soundest methods of dealing with uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
  While the pandemic has created unique challenges for policymakers and
  investors alike, it has also reinforced basic investment principles—including
  the importance of sound asset allocation, consistent with risk tolerances. In
  our view, investors would be well-served to focus on core principles and avoid
  hasty responses to minor changes in the timing of potential Fed policy
  adjustments.
