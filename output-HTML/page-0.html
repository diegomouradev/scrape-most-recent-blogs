  Markets were treated to a kind of miniature “taper tantrum” this week as the
  minutes of the Federal Reserve’s April 27–28 meeting revealed “a number of
  participants” were ready to talk about plans for dialing back the Fed’s
  ongoing asset purchases at upcoming meetings, should the economy continue to
  make “rapid progress.”
</p>
<p>
  And while many observers might think—correctly, in our view—that discussing
  the potential to move away from accommodation is little more than stating the
  obvious, it is at odds with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s recent comments that the
  issue isn’t even under discussion at this stage. This, perhaps, was the source
  of the markets’ consternation.
</p>
<p>
  So with markets already somewhat on edge given ongoing inflation fears, is
  “taper talk” yet another risk for investors to navigate in the coming months?
  After all, this week’s Fed developments follow recent moves by the Bank of
  Canada and the Bank of England to begin the process, in various forms, of
  paring back their asset purchase programs.
</p>
<p>
  As is typically the case with markets, the larger issue concerns what is
  priced in, and what is not. It’s difficult to judge what the market consensus
  might be with respect to expectations for the Fed’s exit, but the New York
  Fed’s own Survey of Market Participants may give us the closest thing to a
  base case.
</p>
<p>
  As the chart illustrates, the March survey showed that most respondents
  expected the Fed’s $240 billion in quarterly Treasury purchases to continue
  through the end of this year, then fall to $205 billion in the first quarter
  of 2022, $160 billion in the second, and ultimately decrease to zero by the
  end of the year. Accordingly, 2023 would remain the first window for the rate
  hike process to begin.

  Powell has been adamant that markets would receive ample warning of the Fed’s
  plans. While discussions are likely to pick up at the central bank’s June
  15–16 meeting, we don’t expect any formal announcement until later in the
  summer. Should the Fed move more quickly than current consensus expectations,
  it could introduce volatility into markets, which we still think the Fed wants
  to avoid given the present uncertainty around the path of the economic
  recovery.
</p>
<h4>If central banks are pulling back, should you?</h4>
<p>
  But as markets look to the Fed’s June meeting for the next policy clues,
  they’re also watching the European Central Bank amid rumblings that it, too,
  could be at the point of dialing back purchases in light of growing optimism
  around the vaccine rollout in Europe and an improving regional growth outlook.
  A move in that direction would put at least four of the major global central
  banks on the path toward some form of policy pullback.
</p>
<p>
  As the chart shows, there has been an apparent correlation between global
  stock prices and the balance sheets of major global central banks. However, we
  maintain that too much has been made of this relationship, and that central
  banks exiting stage left isn’t necessarily a risk for risk assets such as
  stocks and corporate bonds. But it is certainly something to be cognizant of.

  Beneath the surface, the actual relationship between stocks and central bank
  balance sheets has been tenuous at best over the years. The last time U.S.
  markets had to contend with fears around the Fed ceasing its asset purchases
  was at the end of 2014, and while many feared at the time this would put the
  market rally in jeopardy, the S&amp;P 500 went on to deliver returns greater
  than 30% from 2015 through 2018. The same was true at the end of 2017, when
  the Fed’s balance sheet actually began to contract while risk assets continued
  to perform strongly, broadly speaking.
</p>
<h4>Erring on the side of caution</h4>
<p>
  At the end of the day, and regardless of how strong the global recovery from
  the pandemic may be, we believe central banks aren’t going anywhere anytime
  soon. Even if the Fed does wind down its asset purchases by the end of next
  year, the central bank will very likely continue to reinvest interest earned
  and maturing bonds, keeping its balance sheet flat as it did from 2015 through
  2017. We don’t anticipate the outright sale of bond holdings.
</p>
<p>
  The lessons of the central bank experience in the aftermath of the global
  financial crisis showed that the costs of removing accommodation too early can
  be far greater than the costs of moving too late. Nowhere was this seen more
  clearly than in the case of the European Central Bank’s decision to raise
  rates in 2011, only to find itself forced to reverse course almost
  immediately, an episode that culminated in negative policy rates just a few
  years later.
</p>
<p>
  While central banks develop their exit plans, and with headline risks around
  the issue likely to only grow in the months ahead, we believe investors can
  expect ample policy support will likely remain in place over any reasonable
  time horizon.
