  Being born into a multigenerational family business can bring certain
  advantages, but also pressures.
</p>
<p>
  For many, it's natural to want to take the reins of the family business down
  the road. But in some instances, a next-generation family member wants to
  carve out a different journey outside of the family enterprise.
</p>
<p>
  It's important the next generation be able to build their own career<span

<h4>Introducing the next generation to the family business</h4>
<p>
  For Darren Bechtel, part of the fifth generation of the<span>&nbsp;</span
  ><a href="https://www.bechtel.com/" target="_blank" class="link-ext"
    >Bechtel engineering and construction empire<span class="sr-only">
      (Open in new window)</span
    ></a
  >, the introduction to the family business came at a young age.
</p>
<p>
  “I worked every summer from the age of 14. I was a gopher on a home building
  crew. I've been a finish carpenter, a forklift operator, a mason and I did
  project management on some of the Bechtel jobs, including spending a summer
  overseeing a team of pile drivers on the expansion of the world's largest coal
  terminal,” he told a recent virtual seminar hosted by RBC and Campden Wealth.
</p>
<p>
  From there, he moved on to office jobs within the company and then to
  Stanford, where he studied mechanical engineering and later earned an MBA.
</p>
<p>
  It's the type of path one would expect for a next-generation leader of Bechtel
  Corp. It's a company with a nearly unbroken line of family leadership since
  its founding in 1898 and famous for building iconic projects such as the
  Hoover Dam.
</p>
<h4>Starting a new career path</h4>
<p>
  However, Bechtel eventually paved his own path and is now the founder and
  managing director of<span>&nbsp;</span
  ><a href="https://brickmortar.vc/" target="_blank" class="link-ext"
    >Brick &amp; Mortar Ventures<span class="sr-only">
      (Open in new window)</span
    ></a
  >. The company invests in start-ups developing new technology for the
  engineering and construction industries. And Bechtel Corp. remains under
  family leadership, with Bechtel's older brother Brendan Bechtel as chairman
  and chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
  For Bechtel, forging his own path has been a positive experience. “Every day
  that I continue doing my day-to-day as a venture capitalist, I really feel
  like I have found my calling and I'm enjoying it,” he says.

<p>
  However,<span>&nbsp;</span
  ><a href="/ca/en/solution/business-succession-planning-bo/detail/"
    >managing a succession plan for a family business</a
  ><span>&nbsp;</span>can be a tricky exercise, particularly while fostering an
  environment where a next-generation family member can build their own career
  outside of the family business, should they choose to.
</p>
<p>
  “There's a lot of pride in the efforts that have gone into creating a
  successful business and to keep it within the family,” says Ben Winograd,
  managing director of next-generation strategy at RBC. “But I don't think you
  want to necessarily shackle it to your kids if they want to do something
  else.”
</p>
<h4>Start the succession conversation early</h4>
<p>
  It's important for families to begin planning out the approach to succession
  when the next generation is young, explains Winograd. Open lines of
  communication between all generations can help shape future plans. Families
  should discuss what's involved in leadership and whether the interest is there
  from the younger generations. It's something the Bechtel's track record
  suggests they've mastered.
</p>
<p>
  For Bechtel, it was clear from a young age there was a path to success within
  the company if he chose to pursue it. His father also made it clear to him
  that nothing would be handed to him on a platter.
</p>
<p>
  “There was definitely a sit-down conversation to figure out if we would
  actually commit ourselves. He explained that he could assist, but if we
  screwed up he would be the first to fire us. So there was real
  responsibility,” says Bechtel.
</p>
<h4>Setting up family policies for the next generation</h4>
<p>
  At the same time, there was an expectation Bechtel would seek outside
  experience, with a family policy in place that members who wanted to work
  full-time at Bechtel Corp. had to first spend at least two years working
  outside the company.
</p>
<p>
  “That was very deliberately to ensure people did get some exposure to what the
  world outside looked like,” he explains. “The sort of big theme was really
  going and doing the soul searching exercise to figure out if the family
  business is something we truly wanted to do or was it feeling more that we
  should do it.”
</p>
<p>
  While Bechtel's exposure to work outside the company was encouraged by the
  family, there are many reasons a next-generation family member may decide to
  strike off on their own. One is an unwillingness to wait for the current
  generation to hand over the reins.
</p>
<p>
  “What we find with a lot of the next-gens is they wonder if they really want
  to go into a family enterprise if they think mom and dad are going to be there
  and not leave until they're 90 years old. Some of the next generation don't
  want to wait until they're 60 to, as the Royals would say, inherit the
  throne,” says Winograd. “I think that's where it comes down to having a
  conversation around setting expectations.” That sentiment was echoed in recent
  research from RBC,<span>&nbsp;</span
  ><a href="/ca/en/cmp/shaping-tomorrow-today-family-wealth"
    >highlighted in the Shaping tomorrow, today report</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Bechtel joined a commercial architecture firm out of school, and ultimately
  continued through other outside positions, while his brother remained in the
  family enterprise. When the younger brother decided to launch his own venture
  and move into investing in new technologies, it was without family funding
  assistance.
</p>
<p>
  “I was in a position that I could deploy my own capital and sort of gamble
  with my own money; take that risk,” says Bechtel. “I really wanted to make
  sure that what we were building was validated by people outside of the
  family.”
</p>
<h4>External experience is vital for success</h4>
<p>
  While Bechtel is succeeding on his own and the family enterprise continues to
  flourish under his brother, it seems clear the book is not yet closed on
  Bechtel one day contributing to the success of the family business.
</p>
<p>
  By establishing Brick &amp; Mortar, he's helping develop new technologies in
  the very industry where the Bechtel company looms large. This gives him a
  broad level of industry expertise he may not have been able to acquire had he
  stayed at Bechtel Corp.
</p>
<p>
  And Bechtel makes it clear he's not closed the door to one day returning to
  the family enterprise.
</p>
<p>
  “I always thought that someday I might be back,” he says. <span>“</span>But I
  always felt like I had some stuff to get out of my system. By doing so I'd
  hopefully become potentially a stronger candidate for joining Bechtel.”
