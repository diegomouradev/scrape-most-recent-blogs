  Europe, where many countries had to extend lockdown measures, is finally
  emerging from a long economic winter thanks to lower infection rates and an
  accelerating vaccine rollout. RBC Global Asset Management Inc. Chief Economist
  Eric Lascelles points out that while the region previously had been a laggard
  in overall vaccination rates among developed nations, it is now recording some
  of the highest numbers of new inoculations per capita. The two-week rolling
  new doses administered per 100 people in Germany, Spain, and Italy hit a high
  of 11.6, 11.4, and 10.9, respectively, as of May 16, according to Our World in
  Data. This comes against 8.4 in the U.S. and 10.1 in the UK.

  The sharp bounce in the European Commission Economic Sentiment Indicator in
  March, which had seemed to be a precursor to an economic revival, was recently
  corroborated. The IHS Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers’ Index
  (PMI), which had lingered below the 50 level (indicating a contraction) early
  in the year, clawed its way back above 50 (indicating an expansion) in April
  and extended even more in May to 55.1, the highest level in close to three
  years. With France, Italy, and Spain having eased social distancing
  restrictions, activity in the euro area services sector may well recover even
  further in June. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity is plateauing due to
  certain supply chain shortages, but the IHS Markit Eurozone Manufacturing PMI
  has remained above 62, a very healthy level, since March.

      The line chart shows that after bouncing back last year, the IHS Markit
      Eurozone Manufacturing PMI stabilised towards the end of last year through
      to January, before picking up sharply then, driven by increasing global
      demand. It has plateaued at high levels of just above 62.5, being
      currently capped by supply chain shortages.

  Cheered by this brightening backdrop, on May 12 the European Commission
  sharply upgraded its economic forecast for the EU. It now expects GDP growth
  of 4.2 percent year over year in 2021, followed by 4.4 percent in 2022, versus
  its previous forecast for 3.7 percent and 3.9 percent in those years,
  respectively. For the first time, it factored in the impact of the €750
  billion EU recovery fund, which is likely to start distributing funds in the
  third quarter of this year. Half the resources are earmarked for Italy and
  Spain, whose economies have been the hardest hit by the pandemic given their
  large exposure to tourism. Notably, the European Commission significantly
  raised its projections for GDP growth in Italy and Spain, and now sees all
  euro area economies returning to pre-pandemic levels before the end of 2022.
</p>
<h4>Sparking a tapering debate</h4>
<p>
  According to the minutes of its recent meeting, the European Central Bank
  (ECB) has been focused on the strength of the recovery. In a change of tone
  compared to earlier this year, the ECB now sees the risks to activity as being
  marginally tilted “to the upside” in the medium term.
</p>
<p>
  This has sparked a debate as to whether the ECB could start to discuss
  reducing its bond-buying pace under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme
  (PEPP), which the central bank had upped to “significantly higher” a few
  months ago.
</p>
<p>
  However, given the ECB’s determination to “preserve favourable financing
  conditions,” the recent rise in euro area sovereign bond yields, which results
  in higher borrowing costs, has caught the eye of ECB officials. The 10-year
  German Bund yield lurched up to its highest level in almost two years, at
  around -0.11 percent, driven by the improving outlook for Europe.
</p>
<p>
  ECB President Christine Lagarde pushed back on slowing asset purchases under
  PEPP, stating it is too early to remove monetary support. Other ECB officials
  have backed her view, enabling sovereign yields to retreat. We expect the ECB
  will stick to its dovish messaging at the June meeting.
</p>
<p>
  As things stand, markets do not expect the ECB to be quick to increase rates
  as it continues to closely monitor monetary conditions in case they
  deteriorate. Moreover, core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy
  prices) remains subdued at 0.7 percent and there seems to be less risk of wage
  inflation compared to the U.S., where there are reports of labour shortages
  partially due to the generous COVID-19 stimulus cheques incentivising people
  to stay at home. Europe’s existing social support programmes, known as its
  automatic stabilisers, have meant economic compensation per employee was
  capped. Eurozone consensus inflation expectations have increased, but at 1.7
  percent, they remain below the ECB’s two percent target.
</p>
<p>
  The consensus sees the ECB waiting until around mid-2023 to raise its deposit
  rate, currently at -0.5 percent, lagging the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank
  of England. This will likely weigh on the euro, in turn providing a tailwind
  to corporate earnings.
</p>
<h4>Conducive climate for European equities</h4>
<p>
  As macroeconomic momentum builds, earnings delivery is strong and both
  management and consensus forecasts are being revised upwards. The Q1 reporting
  season was exceptionally robust, with companies in the Euro STOXX Index, an
  index of some 300 European companies, easily beating consensus expectations
  and generating earnings per share growth of close to 40 percent year over
  year, driven by sales increases and margin expansion. Moreover, management
  teams overall were optimistic on a demand recovery, though some noted concerns
  regarding supply shortages. Most were confident of their pricing power and
  ability to reduce costs. Following a heady Q1, upgraded forecasts suggest the
  earnings recovery is likely to last into next year. The consensus is looking
  for earnings growth of around 15 percent year over year for 2022.
</p>
<p>
  Our national research correspondent points out that European equities
  typically outperform when bond yields rise, as they have comparatively high
  exposure to groups and sectors that are beneficiaries of rising yields, such
  as Banks, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Materials. Conversely, they
  have relatively lower exposure to Technology and Communication Services,
  sectors that tend to underperform in that environment. We expect both the
  10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the 10-year German Bund yield to close the
  year at slightly higher levels than today.
</p>
<p>
  Valuations for European equities do not seem unduly stretched, in our view. On
  16x the 2022 consensus earnings estimate, the Euro STOXX Index trades at a 20
  percent discount to the S&amp;P 500. It also trades at a wider-than-average
  discount to its U.S. counterpart on a sector-neutral basis.
</p>
<p>
  We continue to favour the Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Materials
  sectors as we believe they are well positioned to benefit from both an
  improving global economy and long-term secular trends. In particular, Europe
  is a global leader in industries geared towards the green economy, ranging
  from renewables operators and green transportation to electrification and
  industrial automation. Companies in the Financials sector remain attractively
  valued, in our view, and are seeing positive consensus earnings revisions.
</p>
<p>
  We believe all of this makes for a conducive climate for European equity
  performance over the next 6–12 months, and we would hold an above-benchmark
  position in portfolios.
