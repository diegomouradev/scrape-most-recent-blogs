  becoming the most diverse group of older generations the country has ever
  seen.
</p>
<p>
  There's a growing awareness among eldercare specialists that a
  one-size-fits-all approach does not work. An individual's ethnicity, religion,
  gender identity or sexual orientation are among some of the many elements that
  should factor into how best to care for older Canadians.
</p>
<p>
  Industry professionals say it's important not only for our institutions, laws
  and healthcare practices to evolve to meet the needs of diverse backgrounds
  and lived experiences, but also to ensure one has legal protections and
  planning in place when those systems are slow to change.
</p>
<p>
  During a recent panel discussion,&nbsp;<i
    >Diversity and aging: Honouring our identities</i
  >, health care and estate planning specialists described how service providers
  need to create safe and comfortable environments for patients and clients to
  speak up. This includes using inclusive language, recognizing their own
  limitations and being mindful of making assumptions.
</p>
<h4>Creating a safe environment for diverse communities</h4>
<p>
  “This is about vulnerability and the importance of why we need to be able to
  provide culturally safe and culturally competent care so that people can be
  themselves,” Dr. Samir Sinha, director of Health Policy Research at the<span

<p>
  The disproportionate way with which COVID-19 has devastated older
  Canadians—especially in long-term care settings—has also raised the basic
  question of how our institutions care for our elderly.
</p>
<p>
  “It strikes me how different societies and different communities value aging
  more than others,” says Sinha, pointing to Indigenous communities and the way
  they prioritize and protect their elders.
</p>
<p>
  Sinha's own patients have included Holocaust and residential school survivors.
  Knowing a patient's background, he says, is incredibly helpful not only from a
  compassionate viewpoint but also in identifying issues that might reappear as
  dementia progresses, such as reliving past trauma. These details also
  influence how you care for older Canadians and respect their own preferences
  and choices as they age, explains Sinha, who's also the director of Geriatrics
  at<span>&nbsp;</span

    >Sinai Health System<span class="sr-only"> (Open in new window)</span></a

</p>
<h4>Using a power of attorney to map future care</h4>

  <a

    >Having legal documents in order</a
  ><span>&nbsp;</span>can also help support the care you need in the future.
  “Maintaining control is an important factor in aging in keeping with your
  identity,” notes Kaufman. “The way to do that is to document your wishes for
  your property and your care in powers of attorney.”
</p>
<p>
  Some people may think<span>&nbsp;</span

  ><span>&nbsp;</span>is a document that only kicks in when they become
  incapacitated. But it can also include decisions around where a person will
  live and what type of home care they'll receive when they become sick. The key
  question to ask is: who would you want to make decisions on your behalf should
  you become incapacitated through health?
</p>
<p>
  “It's a very powerful document that gives the person in charge a lot of
  control,” Darren Lund, a partner with Miller Thomson LLP who specializes in
  estate planning, estate administration and private client matters, told the
  panel.
</p>
<p>
  “The implications can be very significant if the wrong person is making
  decisions.”
</p>
<p>
  Older members of the LGBT+ community, in particular, may have serious concerns
  as they age, including the question of whether they can continue to live
  openly and comfortably should they become dependent on others for care. Who'll
  be responsible should they become incapacitated?
</p>
<p>
  “One of the issues we've seen is that people sometimes feel they have to go
  back into the closet; they no longer want to disclose their sexuality because
  they're afraid that the people coming into their home to care for them will
  actually not treat them well,” Sinha says.
</p>
<p>
  “So for people who've been trying to live independently and freely, they now
  feel they could be victimized in their own home and might not feel safe. It's
  that notion of having to go back into the closet, which can be incredibly
  damaging and concerning.”
</p>
<p>
  When there's inadequate preparation and protection in place, the fallout can
  be costly, not just from a financial point of view, but also from an emotional
  and mental wellbeing point of view, the panelists explained.
</p>
<p>
  In the absence of adequate estate planning, for example, the law often
  defaults the decision-making priority to the next of kin. The assumption is
  the person in charge will understand your wishes and needs. But unless you've
  gone through the planning process with them and documented those wishes, they
  may go unfulfilled.
</p>
<p>
  You could end up with the wrong people making critical life decisions on your
  behalf. Will your burial wishes be respected? Will you get culturally
  appropriate care? What if you have a fractious relationship with your family
  or are estranged from them? And if you're part of the LGBT+ community, what if
  you're not out to your family?
</p>
<p>
  This can lead to damaged relationships and expensive legal challenges, says
  Lund.
</p>
<p>
  “I hear stories of clients who were quite devout during their lifetime and
  then in their burial, their wishes were not fulfilled because the wrong
  executor was in charge,” he explains.
</p>
<h4>Legal rights vary across Canada</h4>
<p>
  There are some aspects of LGBT+ law that still need work. Each jurisdiction is
  different across Canada, but in Ontario, for example, common-law spouses are
  not automatically included in the distribution of an estate if a person dies
  without a Will, according to Lund.
</p>
<p>
  “I think this comes as a surprise to a lot of clients,” Lund adds, noting the
  disproportionate impact that can have when two-thirds of same-sex
  relationships remain common-law.
</p>
<p>
  “For a lot of older LGBTQ-plus clients, their relations were formed before
  same-sex marriage was even an option.” He says despite marriage equity, many
  don't want to get married and this can have a huge impact when it comes to
  estate planning.
</p>
<p>
  Lund has also seen instances where a common-law spouse is the first in line to
  make decisions, but the family doesn't recognize the relationship and there's
  no power of attorney in place.
</p>
<p>
  “You can get enveloped in a dispute about whether that person really is a
  spouse and whether they do have control. So, even though the laws are on your
  side … if you have that extra layer of family conflict, that can slow the
  process down and it can lead to a situation where you're going before an
  administrative tribunal to sort out who's going to be the decision-maker.”
</p>
<p>
  These delays can be extremely harmful to the person at the centre of the
  dispute, especially in cases where decisions about care are urgently required.
</p>
<p>
  Sinha recalls an encounter with a couple who came in with freshly signed
  powers of attorney and tried to claim they were attorneys for one of his
  patients, who was living with dementia. Sinha had already helped the patient
  undergo a licensed capacity assessment and activated her previously declared,
  long-standing powers of attorney for property and for personal care. Sinha was
  able to protect the patient's legacy and wishes that were clearly articulated
  to him and documented over the course of several years.
</p>
<h4>Plan ahead for unforeseen circumstances</h4>
<p>
  “I always say to my patients a great defense is a brilliant offense. And
  planning ahead just protects you from the things that you sometimes don't
  believe could happen, but sadly sometimes do.”
</p>
<p>
  “It's important to think about and voice how we will live and be cared for as
  we age, and how we want to leave things for our loved ones when we are gone,”
  says Kaufman. “Individualized pre-planning is critical in this, taking into
  account our backgrounds and the way we choose to identify when it comes to all
  aspects of our lives.”
</p>
<p>
  The pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of the unexpected, but this is
  particularly true for older Canadians. Getting compassionate care and advice
  can go a long way in reassuring our needs and wishes will be met as we age.
